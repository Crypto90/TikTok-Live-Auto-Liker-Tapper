# TikTok Live Auto Liker / Tapper

A lightweight Windows desktop application built with Python and CustomTkinter that automates "liking" on TikTok Live streams. It works by sending virtual keypresses ('L') to a specific TikTok window, even if it is running in the background.

## 🚀 Features
- **Automatic Window Detection:** Automatically finds open browser windows containing "TikTok".
- **Background Support:** Uses Win32 API to send inputs directly to the window without stealing your mouse focus.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, dark-mode interface powered by CustomTkinter.
- **Multi-threaded:** The UI remains responsive while the tapper runs in the background.
